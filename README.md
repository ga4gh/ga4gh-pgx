# ga4gh-pgx
GA4GH Pharmacogenomics Study Group

Aims to develop a pharmacogenomics data standard to address translational gaps across disparate health systems and enable equitable clinical decision support

The lack of pharmacogenomics (PGx) data standards is a barrier to interoperability and widespread sustainable utilisation of PGx data. To address this, the GA4GH PGx Data Standardisation Study Group brings together the clinical and informatics communities to understand current practices and share learning, review existing models and identify gaps, and explore development of a PGx data model.
